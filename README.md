### Quicksort Algorithm: Code, Results, and Analysis

**Description**: The quicksort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a “pivot” element from an array (or list or sequence), and partitions the remaining elements into two separate sub-arrays based on whether they are greater or less than the pivot element, then proceeds to recursively sort the subarrays in the same manner until the entire array is sorted.

#### Instructions
Run [quicksort.py](https://github.com/z3301/algo_p1/quicksort.py) in your favorite Python iterpreter.
